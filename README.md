This project studies the surface motion of nanomachines on graphene substrates.
We do this by comparing the results of all-atomic molecular dynamics in a variety of atomistic models.
we study several effects that can control the dynamics of nanomachines on graphene surfaces:
1) the role of substrate flexibility;
we consider the motion of nanocars on single-layer graphene (SLG) and frozen layer graphene (FLG) surfaces.
2) the role of the chassis flexibility. 
we choose two nanocars with four C60 wheels in each, but different in their chassis rigidity: the Nanocar and Nanotruck.

The animation of the simulations in variety of models are presented here.
The input codes related to LAMMPS package simulation are on "LAMMPS_Codes" directory.
The digital equivalent of the diagrams are on "Figures_Data" directory.
The post-process codes with Matlab are on "Matlab_Codes" directory.
